WALKTHROUGH.

The escape button can be pressed during the credits or game over screen to return to the main menu.
If you press escape during the game, it will be paused and you will see options, such as audio, on/off
and controls. Controls will display all the mouse and keyboard inputs for the game.

When you come back out of the menu you need to right click to remove the mouse.

Step by Step.
You start the game in the courtyard, walk to your left to talk to the mage. Press 'E' to 
talk to him and he'll tell you his brother went through the blue door. Jump on the barrels next 
to the wall to get onto the roof of the shack and then jump onto the plank to get to the blue
key. This will grant you access to the blue boor. Once inside this room keep to the right and you will 
eventually find the red key. Left click to shoot any enemies along the way. Once you get the key
head back the way you came, but go the opposite direction to when you entered. This will bring you
to a red door which you have the key for. Inside you will need to kill the boss and pick the book
up that he drops. We then need to return this to the dead mage's brother that we spoke to earlier.
Also, Just outside this room there is a map that you can use to escape the maze. Once you talk 
to the brother and show him his brother's book he will realise he's dead and give you the green key. 
This allows you to open the last door and go into the maze. Go slowly because there are spike traps
in the maze that take 50hp. The easiest way out of the maze is to stay to the right. Once you are
out the game will end and the credits will play. Press escape to get back to the menu.
